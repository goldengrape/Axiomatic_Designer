DP0: Workflow & State Controller

Responsibilities:
- Manages system state according to pre-defined workflow models (e.g., "write-review-revise" cycle).
- Coordinates and calls services of other DPs (DP5, DP6, DP7, DP8) to advance the workflow.
- Interacts with other DPs through well-defined interfaces.
- This is a PURELY ARCHITECTURAL COORDINATION component and does not implement any FR directly.
